This is a Java program that compares two strings where one string may contain the character '#', which works
like a backspace button on a keyboard.

The program takes two strings as input and returns true if the first string is equal to the second string after
applying the backspace rule.

Here is an example of how to use the program:
System.out.println("1 " + compareStrings("java##", "ja"));   // true
System.out.println("2 " + compareStrings("##java", "java")); // true
System.out.println("3 " + compareStrings("ja#va#", "jv"));   // true
System.out.println("4 " + compareStrings("ja#va###", ""));   // true

The program works by first converting the input string into a list of characters. It then iterates through the list,
removing any occurrence of '#' and the character to its left.

After applying the backspace rule, the remaining characters are then used to create a new string that is compared
to the second input string using the equals() method.

If the two strings are equal, the program returns true; otherwise, it returns false.

The program makes use of the ArrayList and StringBuilder classes in the Java Collections Framework
to efficiently handle the string manipulations.
