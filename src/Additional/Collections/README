This package contains classes with different data structures, and the basic commands for collections are executed
for the purpose of practicing and mastering the material. The classes include examples of ArrayList, LinkedList,
HashMap, TreeMap, HashSet, and TreeSet, and demonstrate basic operations such as adding and removing elements,
sorting, iterating through the collection, and using comparators and predicates.
